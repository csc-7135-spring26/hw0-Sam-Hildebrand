# Hello!
*I finished the homework*.

## About me,
I've been using markdown and git since 2018, which is over ~~7~~ 8 years (it's ***2026***).

I can't think of any more markdown things to do.

I'm pretty comfortable with git, github. One of my favorite things about GitHub is GitHub Actions, which is probably old news at this point, but the ability to spin up a mini vm on a pull request and run tests or test compiliation or whatever is so cool.

I guess the thing I've learned is that more people know Git now that when I was in your undergrad class 3 years ago. There's been a pretty big push to teach git and how to interact as a team in earlier undergrad class in the past 3 years, a few of my friends are actually instructors now and I think this has helped.
